AnyTrans: Translate AnyText in the Image with Large Scale Models
=========
:tada::tada::tada:
This is a brief implementation of AnyTrans proposed by our paper ["AnyTrans: Translate AnyText in the Image with Large Scale Models"].**(EMNLP2024 Findings)**

Since our framework is quite simple, we only provide a general framework, and users can add LLM or erase tools according to their needs.
